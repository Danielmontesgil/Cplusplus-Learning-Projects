# C++ Learning Projects

This repository is dedicated to putting my C++ knowledge into practice, as my professional experience is primarily focused on C#. My goal is to improve my C++ skills through consistent, hands-on coding. To achieve this, I am actively working on two main projects: a [prototype](https://github.com/Danielmontesgil/UnrealCommonUI) in Unreal Engine using C++, and this repository which contains pure C++ projects.

### Projects Available in This Repository:

- [Hangman](https://github.com/Danielmontesgil/Cplusplus-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Hangman): A console-based version of the classic game, featuring different modes and AI integration.
  
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Danielmontesgil/Cplusplus-Learning-Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe): A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering multiple game modes and a custom AI opponent.

Feel free to explore the projects and see my progress as I refine my C++ skills!
